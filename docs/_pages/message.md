# About

Amdocs is pleased to announce the release of our first Open Source project, Zusammen. 

Zusammen can be downloaded from [zusammen.io](http://zusammen.io/) from today.

Zusammen is a document store that is designed specifically to facilitate collaborative work. It enables application creators to add collaboration features to their product with ease.

The major benefits of Zusammen are its collaborative features, flexible versioning mechanism, fast searching, and easy merging. Also, it provides schema-free data management.

Whether your application enables a team to write an article together, to design a model, or to contribute to other joint efforts, Zusammen user collaboration will make collaborative application development both fast and easy.

Zusammen has been designed from day one for user extensibility. This means that you can use Zusammen as a whole, or replace the default plug-ins with plug-ins that better meet your organizational needs.
